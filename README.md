## Instructions ##
The data consists of three files:

**Species list:** This file is in excel format, and has organismal groups in different tabs. Each tab lists species under that organismal group and their taxonomic details. All the species listed in Zooplankton, Prawns, Mollusca, Aquatic insects, Fish, and Herpetofauna are all completely wetland-dependent. We have provided a full list of Mammals and Aves found in and around the habitat and earmarked the wetland-dependent species with a special column (WETLAND_DEP) with 1 denoting wetland dependence. We have also provided a los


Trophic interaction list:  This file is in comma-separated values format (.csv). The different columns depict:
SL: Serial number of species
Species: Name of the species
PREMONSOON: Whether the species has been observed in the Premonsoon season
MONSOON: Whether the species has been observed in the Monsoon season
POSTMONSOON: Whether the species has been observed in the Postmonsoon season
FUNC_GRP: Organismal group of the species (Autotrophs, Zooplankton, Prawns, Aquatic Insects, Fish, Aves, Mammal, Mollusca, Reptiles, Amphibians)
HABITAT: Habitat type of the species (Terrestrial, Limnetic, Littoral, Profundal, Benthic, Neustonic)
SIZE_CAT: Size categories of the species as per the following:
1: <1 mm
2: ~1 cm
3: 1-10 cm
4: 10-50 cm
5: 50-100 cm
6: >100 cm


REL_ABUN_CAT: Whether the species is rare (1), common (2), or very common (3)
FEEDING_REF: Feeding reference from literature which also documents our observed interactions (not necessarily all were seen previously)
